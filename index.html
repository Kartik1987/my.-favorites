    <h2 class="orange">Hockey</h2>
  
    <p>
      Hockey is my favorite sport and has been a big part of my life. Although I play for fun, I still love to practice and compete with my team. I've been rooting for the Edmonton Oilers since the 2016-2017 playoff run. My favorite moment was when they beat Calgary in 2022 in the 2nd round of the Stanley cup playoffs! I also am a big fan of the World Juniors. Aside from hockey, I also love watching the FIFA world cup.
